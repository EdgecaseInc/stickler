== DESCRIPTION

Stickler is a tool to organize and maintain an internal gem distribution server.

At times it is useful to have complete control over the availability of the gems
for you testing, staging and production environments.  In these cases you
probably do not want to accidentally type 'gem update' and get a new untested
version of a gem installed on your machines.  This is where Stickler helps.

Configure stickler with the the names and versions of the gems you require for
your deployment and it will organize and setup a gem server to serve up only
those gems.

== INSTALLATION

Install as a gem:

   sudo gem install stickler

Or Get it from RubyForge[http://rubyforge.org/projects/copiousfreetime/] 
or github[http://github.com/copiousfreetime/stickler/tree/master]

== FEATURES

* Serve up a custom collection of gems for your own use.
* Generation of a custom 'sources' gem to have your rubygems installations point
  to your custom gem server.
* Tracking of the gems you care about and notification when a new version of those
  are released on rubyforge.
* Integrates with your internal build system so your internal gems can be
  deployed to the stickler gem server
