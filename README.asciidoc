Overview
--------

Stickler is a tool to organize and maintain an internal gem repository.
Primarily, you would want to use Stickler if:

1. You have proprietary gems that you want to have available via a gem server so 
   you may +gem install+ them.
2. You would like to have a local mirror of third party gems from either 
   http://rubygems.org or some other gem server.
3. You want both (1) and (2) in the same server.

Installation
------------

Installing stickler may be done via the standard gem installation

--------------------
gem install stickler
--------------------

Or downloaded from http://github.com/copiousfreetime/stickler/downloads
